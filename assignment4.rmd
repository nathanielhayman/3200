2. b) How many paths going from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of this
grid and passing through the circled point are there?

$$
{5 \choose 3}{3 \choose 2}=30
$$

c) If a path is selected at random, what is the probability it will pass through the
circled point?

$$
\frac{{5 \choose 3}{3 \choose 2}}{{8 \choose 4}}=0.429
$$
